      Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
      Would it be the same if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
      I must be strong and carry on, <br>
      'Cause I know I don't belong here in Heaven. <br>
      <br>
      Would you hold my hand if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
      Would you help me stand if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
      I'll find my way through night and day, <br>
      'Cause I know I just can't stay here in Heaven. <br>
      <br>
      Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees. <br>
      Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please. <br>
      <br>
      Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure, <br>
      And I know there'll be no more tears in Heaven. <br>
      <br>
      Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
      Would it be the same if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
      I must be strong and carry on, <br>
      'Cause I know I don't belong here in Heaven. <br>
