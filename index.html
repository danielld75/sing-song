        Could you know my name if I saw you in Heaven? <br>

        Would it be the same if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
        I must be strong and carry on, <br>
        'Cause I know I don't belong here in Heaven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Would you hold my hand if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
        Would you help me stand if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
        I'll find my way through night and day, <br>
        'Cause I know I just can't stay here in Heaven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees. <br>
        Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure, <br>
        And I know there'll be no more tears in Heaven.

        Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
        Would it be the same if I saw you in Heaven? <br>
        I must be strong and carry on, <br>
        'Cause I know I don't belong here in Heaven.
