      Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven?
      Would it be the same if I saw you in Heaven?
      I must be strong and carry on,
      'Cause I know I don't belong here in Heaven.
    </em>
    <em>
      Would you hold my hand if I saw you in Heaven?
      Would you help me stand if I saw you in Heaven?
      I'll find my way through night and day,
      'Cause I know I just can't stay here in Heaven.
    </em>
    <em>  
      Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees.
      Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please.
    </em>
    <em>
      Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure,
      And I know there'll be no more tears in Heaven.
    </em>
